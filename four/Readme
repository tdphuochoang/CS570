Please elaborate how you implement your FIFO and LRU replacement algorithm.
You need to explain your design, not just paste source code here ... 

FIFO()
To implement the FIFO page replacement algorithm:
* First intitialize required variables and page frame pointer.
* Set the default value of flag to 0.
* For each frame, compare the requested page to the existing content of PageFrameList
* As page found, flag is turned 1
* If the page does not exist in frame, place that page in the jth location in PageFrameList
* Update the j for next cycle and increment counter for page fault.

LRU()
To implement the LRU page replacement algorithm:
* First intitialize required variables and page frame pointer.
* Set the default value of flag to 0.
* For each frame, compare the requested page to the existing content of PageFrameList
* As page found, flag is turned 1
* If there is no empty slot is found then we sort for the LRU page. 
* Check on the previous value of current frame to find the LRU page. 
* Put the requested page where the status is 0.
